def repeated_pattern(array):
    length = len(array)
    half = Math.floor(length/2)
    for i = 2 in range(2,half):
        i = 2 then the pattern is [1,2]
        then we need to loop through the array if it has 2 patterns


repeated_pattern([1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2])
repeated_pattern([1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2])
repeated_pattern([5,1,2,2])
repeated_pattern([4,4,4])
